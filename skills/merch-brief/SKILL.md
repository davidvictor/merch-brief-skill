description: Generate a bespoke branded-merch creative brief plus a complete deliverable — visual tech pack (range grid, product heroes, lookbook, embellishment macros, contextual placement), a cinematic hero image, a branded single-page presentation website with OG card, the real brand logo, and optional GitHub repo + Vercel deploy. Modeled on what a high-end merch agency (e.g. Magnum Opus) hands a client. Trigger when the user asks to "make merch", "design a merch program", "merch tech pack", "branded swag", "tour merch", "event merch", "branded apparel range", "build a merch deck", or names a brand/event and wants ideas/mockups/a shippable concept site for swag, drops, or capsule collections.

# merch-brief

End-to-end skill for producing a bespoke branded-merch concept package and shipping it as a live presentation site. Takes a **brand** and an **optional creative direction**, researches the brand into a canonical creative brief, generates a full set of visual artifacts via Higgsfield, composes a branded single-page website, and optionally ships it to GitHub + Vercel.

The full deliverable, end to end, in one pass:

1. **Brand research** — Higgsfield brand-kit fetch + supplementary web research
2. **Creative brief** — `BRIEF.md` (palette, motifs, range plan, embellishment plan) — *gated on user approval*
3. **Sequenced image pipeline** — 7 sequential rounds, all on `nano_banana_pro`, each one using prior rounds as `medias[]` references:
   0. Cast (portrait refs for male + female stand-in models)
   1. Location plates (empty environments)
   2. Brand mnemonics (wordmark / motif / palette tile on swatch)
   3. Piece mockups (each SKU as a flat-lay product hero, referencing the mnemonics)
   4. Line sheet (gridded composite, referencing all mockups)
   5. Model-in-environment lookbook (Cast portrait + location + mockup)
   6. Hero image (cinematic 16:9 — Cast portrait + location + hero-piece mockup)
4. **Real brand logo** — pulled from Higgsfield brand-kit OR Wikimedia Commons fallback
5. **Branded site** — `index.html` (single-page), `og.png` (1200×630 social card), `BRIEF.md`, `INDEX.md`
6. **Ship** *(optional, gated)* — private GitHub repo + Vercel deploy

## When to use

Use this skill when the user wants any of:
- A merch capsule, drop, tour line, event swag, or branded apparel range
- A visual "tech pack" — a gridded line plan showing the SKUs front/back/colorways
- Mockups of branded merchandise (tees, hoodies, caps, totes, accessories, premium objects)
- A creative brief ready to hand to a manufacturer or designer
- A live presentation site (or pitch deck) for any of the above

Do **not** use it for: general logo design (use brand-guidelines), a single one-off mockup with no range thinking, or animation/video (use Higgsfield's video tools directly).

## Inputs

Collect at intake (use AskUserQuestion if any are unclear, but never block on optional fields):

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `brand` | yes | Brand or event name. "Bacardi", "Coachella 2026", "Burberry", "Red Bull Air Race" |
| `brand_url` | recommended | Canonical site. If user didn't supply, search for it and confirm with the user once before scraping. |
| `creative_direction` | no | Free-text, layered ON TOP of the brand's intrinsic identity. Examples of how a user might phrase it: "dark vintage washed gothic", "soft refined, no logos screaming", "stadium-giveaway pull-tabs vibe", "archive-era heritage". Preserve verbatim in the brief. |
| `occasion` | no | "Album tour", "Q4 holiday drop", "Stagecoach 2026 staff merch", "Venice Beach edition" |
| `audience` | no | "Streetwear collectors", "festival GA", "international elevated" |
| `tier` | no | `quick` (4 + hero = 5 images) / `standard` (9 + hero = 10, default) / `deluxe` (14 + hero = 15) |
| `ship` | no | `true` if user wants the deck pushed to GitHub + deployed to Vercel. Default `false`. |

If `brand` is missing, ask. Everything else has good defaults.

---

## Phase 1 — Brand kit research

The goal is a structured understanding of the brand's existing visual identity, **before** any generation.

1. If `brand_url` is set or you can confidently identify the canonical site, **kick off Higgsfield's brand-kit fetch immediately** (it's async, takes ~30s):
   ```
   mcp__higgsfield__show_marketing_studio(
     action='fetch', type='brand_kit', scrap_url='<brand_url>'
   )
   ```
   Save the returned `brand_kit_id` — you'll poll it in Phase 5 for the official logo.

2. While the kit is fetching, supplement with a quick web pass using `/browse` or `/defuddle`:
   - Recent campaign/lookbook imagery — what aesthetic moment is the brand in *right now*?
   - Past merch drops (search "<brand> merch drop", "<brand> capsule", "<brand> tour merch")
   - Cultural references the brand leans on (music, sport, subculture, era)

3. If the brand is an **event** (festival, tournament, conference): also pull venue/city motifs, dates, headliners or stars, sponsors, prior-year merch.

4. If `creative_direction` is empty, **derive one** from the research: 2–3 sentences capturing the proposed aesthetic, an era reference, and an embellishment direction.

---

## Phase 2 — Synthesize the creative brief

Write `BRIEF.md` in a working folder `~/Documents/merch-briefs/<brand-slug>-<YYYY-MM-DD>/`. The brief is the contract — it drives every prompt downstream.

**Use [`glossary.md`](./glossary.md) as the controlled vocabulary** when writing this brief and every prompt in Phase 3. The glossary covers fabric weights, weaves, fits, construction, embellishments (embroidery + print), washes, trims/hardware, typography, and photography/lighting — with brand references per section for taste calibration. Pull terms from it instead of inventing vocabulary; the brief should read like a real tech pack, not a fashion blog. Don't keyword-stuff — pick 2–4 specific terms per spec line that actually communicate the choice.

Required sections (markdown):

```markdown
# {{Brand}} — {{Occasion}}
### Merch Brief
*Audience: {{audience}} · Date: {{today}}*

## One-line pillar
{{single sentence: what this drop IS at its core}}

## Creative direction
*(User direction, preserved):* {{user's creative_direction verbatim, or "derived from research" if absent}}

{{2–4 sentences. Era/reference + mood + key tension. Build around the user's direction; never overwrite it.}}

## Palette
- **{{Color name}}** `#xxxxxx` — {{role}}
- ... 5–7 colors total

## Typography
- **Display:** {{family + feel}}
- **Body / labels:** {{family + feel}}
- **Wordmark treatment:** {{embellishment treatment for primary mark}}

## Garment language
{{fabric weight, fit cut, wash, garment-dye notes — 2–4 sentences}}

## Motif library
1. **{{motif}}** — {{where it lives}}
2. ... 4–7 motifs

## Embellishment plan
{{embroidery / chain-stitch / chenille / puff print / silkscreen / heat transfer / patchwork / sublimation — where each goes for each piece}}

## Range plan
| # | SKU | Garment spec | Colorways | Embellishments | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Hero piece** | ... | ... | ... | Hero |
| ... | 6–10 SKUs total per tier |

## Lookbook & context direction
- **Lookbook environment:** {{specific place description}}
- **Contextual placement:** {{specific lifestyle scene}}
- **Embellishment macros:** {{which embellishments to feature}}

## References
- ... 3–6 references (other brands, eras, specific past collections)

## Trademark fidelity note
The {{brand}} mark and wordmark in generated images will be approximate — these are concept renders for direction approval. Real artwork applied by a designer with the official brand kit.
```

### Brief → glossary section map

When filling each `BRIEF.md` section, pull vocabulary from these specific [`glossary.md`](./glossary.md) sections:

| BRIEF.md section | Glossary sections to pull from |
|---|---|
| `## Palette` | §7 (Washes & finishes) — for surface-treatment vocabulary that accompanies color names |
| `## Typography` | §9 (Typography & display) — display family, label/mono family, wordmark treatment |
| `## Garment language` | §1 (Fabric weights), §2 (Weaves & knit structures), §3 (Fits & silhouettes), §7 (Washes & finishes) |
| `## Motif library` | freeform — pull light rendering vocabulary from §5 (Embroidery) / §6 (Print methods) when describing how each motif lives on the garment |
| `## Embellishment plan` | §5 (Embroidery), §6 (Print methods), §8 (Trims & hardware) |
| `## Range plan` | per row: §1 (weight), §2 (weave), §3 (fit), §5/§6 (embellishment), §7 (wash) |
| `## Lookbook & context direction` | §10 (Photography & lighting) for the lighting + lens grammar |

**Gate:** Show the brief to the user and get sign-off before Phase 3. Generation costs credits — don't burn them on the wrong direction.

---

## Phase 3 — Sequenced image generation pipeline

**This is the most important part of the skill.** Each round builds on the last. Earlier rounds become *reference inputs* for later rounds via Higgsfield's `medias[]` parameter — passing prior `job_id`s in by reference keeps the visual world (location, fabric, embellishments, model identity) coherent across the whole deliverable.

**Do not fire everything in parallel.** Each round must complete before the next starts. Within a round, fire calls in parallel; between rounds, poll the previous round to completion first.

```
Round 0 — Cast            (portrait refs, male + female)   ──┐
Round 1 — Locations       (env. plates)                    ──┤
Round 2 — Brand mnemonics (motifs, palette)                ──┼─→ medias[] in Round 3
Round 3 — Piece mockups   (flat-lay heroes)                ──┼─→ medias[] in 4, 5, 6
Round 4 — Line sheet      (gridded composite of mockups)   ──┤
Round 5 — Model in env.   (Cast + Location + Mockup)       ──┤
Round 6 — Hero image      (Cast + Location + hero Mockup)  ──┘
```

**One model handles all of it: `nano_banana_pro`.** It accepts unlimited references via `medias[]` and is provably good at compositing — Round 4 pulls every Round 3 mockup into one coherent line sheet, and Rounds 5/6 pull a Cast portrait + Round 1 location + Round 3 mockup into one coherent lookbook frame. Same trick, same model, top to bottom.

(`soul_2` and Soul Character training are not used. They're a viable alternative if you want trained reusable identities across many decks, but for a single deck the nano_banana_pro `medias[]` compositing approach is faster, cheaper, and avoids the 10-minute training wait.)

### Tier counts

| Round | Component | quick | standard | deluxe |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Cast — portrait refs *per character × 2 characters* | 2 + 2 | 3 + 3 | 4 + 4 |
| 1 | Location plates | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 2 | Brand mnemonics | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| 3 | Piece mockups | 4 | 6 | 9 |
| 4 | Line sheet *(4k)* | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 5 | Model in environment | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 6 | Hero *(4k)* | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| **Total images** | | **14** | **21** | **30** |
| **Credits at default res (2k everywhere + 4k for line sheet & hero)** | | **~32** | **~46** | **~62** |
| **Credits at max res (4k everywhere)** | | **~56** | **~84** | **~120** |

Default resolution policy raises every round to `2k` (same cost as 1k) and bumps the line sheet + hero to `4k` for ~4 extra credits total — they're the two images that bear the most attention. If the user says "max quality", push every round to `4k` and budget accordingly.

### Model routing (applies to all rounds)

- **Use `nano_banana_pro` for everything.** Empty environments, swatches, flat-lay garments, gridded composites, *and* on-figure shots. It accepts unlimited references via `medias[]` and composites them reliably — the line sheet is the proof.
- `marketing_studio_image` requires a linked product object via Marketing Studio — only use when the user has an actual SKU URL/upload, not for concept renders.
- `soul_2` and Soul Character training are *available* if a project genuinely needs a reusable trained identity across many future decks — but for any single deck, `nano_banana_pro` with portrait refs in `medias[]` is the recommended path.

### Resolution defaults (uplevel quality, credits are not the constraint)

`nano_banana_pro` accepts `resolution: '1k' | '2k' | '4k'` (per `models_explore`). Pricing is **flat at 1k and 2k (2 credits), doubled at 4k (4 credits)** — confirmed via `get_cost`. There is no reason to ever ship at 1k.

Defaults the skill uses:

| Round | Resolution | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Cast | `2k` | Face detail matters; 2k costs the same as 1k |
| 1 — Locations | `2k` | Reference plate, not a hero |
| 2 — Brand mnemonics | `2k` | Macro fabric/thread detail benefits from 2k |
| 3 — Piece mockups | `2k` | Catalog-grade flat-lays |
| 4 — Line sheet | **`4k`** | Most-shared single image, busiest composition, worth the +2c |
| 5 — Model in env. | `2k` | Portrait fidelity at 2k is more than enough |
| 6 — Hero | **`4k`** | The website's primary visual, worth the +2c |

Pass `resolution: '2k'` (or `'4k'`) as a top-level param inside `params` on every `generate_image` call. If the user explicitly says *"max quality"* or *"render everything at the top tier"*, push every round to `4k`. The cost roughly doubles but every artifact will be print-grade.

### Speed

`nano_banana_pro` jobs typically complete in 10–20s at 1k/2k and 20–30s at 4k. Higgsfield's `job_status(sync: true)` blocks ~25s server-side, so a 4k job may need one extra poll. That's fine — fire the round, then issue `job_status` calls in parallel for every job in the round; the harness is notified per completion.

The skill never uses `soul_2`'s `use_relax: true` mode (which trades wait time for cheaper credits). For this skill, latency is the more valuable resource — keep `use_relax: false` if `soul_2` ever does come into play.

### Image-to-image referencing

Higgsfield's `generate_image(params={...})` accepts `medias: [{value, role}]` where:
- `value` = a prior generation's `job_id` (preferred — server resolves to CDN URL)
- `role` = `"image"` for `nano_banana_pro`. If uncertain, call `models_explore(action='get', model_id='nano_banana_pro')` and inspect `medias[].roles`.

Passing references **does not lock the output to the reference** — it conditions the generation. Multiple references compound (mnemonic + mockup, or portrait + location + mockup → grounded lookbook). There's no hard upper bound documented; the line sheet round routinely passes 6+ refs without issue.

### Preflight

Before Round 0, **preflight cost** on one representative `nano_banana_pro` call (`get_cost: true`) at 4:5 2k AND at 16:9 4k so the spread is visible. Check `balance`. Surface the total spend estimate (~32 / 46 / 62 credits at default resolution policy; ~56 / 84 / 120 if pushing every round to 4k). Get a go-ahead.

Every `generate_image` call in every round should include `resolution` per the table above — `'2k'` is the default for most rounds, `'4k'` for Round 4 (line sheet) and Round 6 (hero). If the user said "max quality", set every call to `'4k'`.

**Use [`glossary.md`](./glossary.md) for every prompt's technical vocabulary.** Embellishments come from §5–6, fabrics from §1–2, fits from §3, construction from §4, finishes from §7, trims from §8. Lighting/lens clauses for portrait and lookbook prompts come from §10. Don't keyword-stuff — 2–4 specific terms per prompt clause is the sweet spot.

---

### Round 0 — Cast

Generate clean portrait references for two stand-in models — one male, one female. These become `medias[]` inputs in Rounds 5 and 6 so the same person appears across every shot they're in.

Default to **one male + one female** so the lookbook can show the line on both. Adapt to the brand if it's clearly gendered (menswear-only, womenswear-only) or has a single fronting persona.

- **Model:** `nano_banana_pro`
- **Aspect:** `1:1` (clean square reference, no body context)
- **Cost:** ~2 credits each
- **Count:** 2–4 per character × 2 characters by tier (just enough variety in angle/expression to give the compositing room to work — we are NOT training Soul Characters here)
- **Vocabulary sources** ([`glossary.md`](./glossary.md)): §10 (Photography & lighting) for the studio lighting clause and backdrop tone.

For each character, use the *same* identity description across all their refs — vary only angle and expression. Keep the descriptions concrete: age, build, hair color/length, skin tone, distinguishing features, vibe. **Pull the character archetype from the brief's audience and brand world** — Stagecoach characters look different from Burberry characters.

**Prompt template:**
> Studio portrait, {{angle — front-facing / three-quarter left / three-quarter right}}, {{expression — neutral / soft smile / serious}}. A {{age}}-year-old {{gender}} with {{hair description}}, {{skin tone}}, {{build}}, {{distinguishing features}}, {{vibe — "old-money European taste" / "weathered ranch worker" / "downtown art-school" / etc.}}. Wearing a plain {{neutral color}} t-shirt. Plain {{light grey / cream / sky}} studio backdrop. Soft directional light from upper-left, even tone. Sharp focus on the face. No props, no styling beyond the plain tee. Clean catalog reference quality.

Fire all male + female ref prompts in parallel. **Poll to completion.** Save the `job_id`s — these are the character references for Rounds 5 and 6.

---

### Round 1 — Locations

Generate the physical world(s) the line lives in. **These plates have no garments and no models** — they're empty environmental references the rest of the pipeline will inhabit. Pulled directly from the `## Lookbook & context direction` section of `BRIEF.md`.

- **Model:** `nano_banana_pro`
- **Aspect:** `16:9` (so they double as hero-backdrop candidates)
- **Cost:** ~2 credits each
- **Vocabulary sources** ([`glossary.md`](./glossary.md)): §10 (Photography & lighting) — pull time-of-day, light direction, film stock, focal-length equivalent, grain notes. This round IS the lighting grammar reference for Rounds 5 and 6.

Each location plate should be a single specific place at a single specific time of day, captured the way a photographer scouts it: clean composition, all the environmental cues present, but no action happening yet.

**Prompt template:**
> Cinematic empty-set establishing photograph of {{specific location from brief}}, {{time of day}}. No people, no garments, no models in frame. The setting shows: {{1–3 concrete environmental elements from brief — boardwalk, hangar floor, rattan beach chairs, dirt two-track, stage trusses, etc.}}. {{Light direction and quality, color cast}}. Shot on {{35mm film stock / medium-format feel}}, {{grain notes}}, {{focal length}} equivalent. Wide composition with negative space where a subject could later stand. Editorial location scout quality.

Fire 1–3 location prompts in parallel. **Poll all to completion** before Round 2.

---

### Round 2 — Brand mnemonics

The design system, rendered as physical artifacts. These set the visual language — fabric color, thread texture, motif rendering, embellishment treatment — that Round 3 will use as `medias[]` references for piece-level consistency.

- **Model:** `nano_banana_pro`
- **Aspect:** `1:1`
- **Cost:** ~2 credits each
- **Count:** 2–4 mnemonics depending on tier
- **Vocabulary sources** ([`glossary.md`](./glossary.md)): §1–§2 (material — fabric weight + weave/knit), §5 (Embroidery) or §6 (Print methods) for the rendering technique, §8 (Trims & hardware — woven label / jacron / leather patch / hangtag), §9 (Typography & display — wordmark treatment), §10 (Photography & lighting — light direction, raked vs top-down).

Each mnemonic is a single artifact shown at macro scale on a clean ground. Pull from the brief's `## Motif library`, `## Embellishment plan`, and `## Typography` sections. A representative set:

1. **Wordmark on a swatch** — the property name (not the brand's real wordmark) embroidered / chain-stitched / silkscreened on the brand's hero fabric in the brand's display treatment.
2. **Signature motif on a swatch** — the brief's #1 motif rendered in the brief's chosen embellishment technique on a small piece of the hero fabric.
3. **Palette tile** — a row of fabric squares in the brief's 4–6 palette colors, with mono color names lettered below each.
4. **Hangtag macro** *(deluxe only)* — the brand's hangtag rendered as a paper/leather/woven artifact with mono data, stitching/grommet visible.

**Prompt template:**
> Macro studio photograph of {{mnemonic — wordmark on fabric / motif on fabric / palette tile / hangtag}}. {{Specific material — brushed merino-cotton, supplex nylon, raw cotton canvas, etc.}} in {{specific color}}. The {{wordmark / motif / pattern}} is {{embellishment technique — chain-stitch / woven label / discharge silkscreen / sublimation}} in {{thread/ink colors}}, reading {{exact text or motif description}}. {{Detail of the technique — visible thread loops, merrowed edge, fiber detail}}. {{Light direction, raked or top-down}}. Tight square crop. Like a sample card from a heritage merch atelier.

Fire all mnemonics in parallel. **Poll to completion.** Save the job_ids — they're the reference library for Round 3.

---

### Round 3 — Piece mockups

Each SKU as an individual flat-lay product hero on a clean seamless backdrop. **This is where `medias[]` starts paying off** — reference one or more Round 2 mnemonics so the embellishment technique, thread color, and fabric language stay consistent across every piece.

- **Model:** `nano_banana_pro`
- **Aspect:** `4:5`
- **Cost:** ~2 credits each
- **Count:** 4 / 6 / 9 SKUs by tier
- **References:** pass the relevant Round 2 mnemonic job_id(s) via `medias`
- **Vocabulary sources** ([`glossary.md`](./glossary.md)): §1 (Fabric weights — oz / GSM), §2 (Weaves & knit structures), §3 (Fits & silhouettes — boxy / cropped / oversized / raglan / etc.), §4 (Seams & construction — flatlock / bartack / topstitch / single-needle / piping), §5 (Embroidery technique), §6 (Print method), §7 (Washes & finishes — garment-dyed / pigment / sun-faded / etc.), §8 (Trims & hardware — labels, patches, closures), §10 (Photography & lighting — soft directional light clause). **Pick 2–4 specific terms per prompt clause** — don't keyword-stuff or the model produces a confused composite.

Pull from `## Range plan` in the brief — generate one mockup per row, ordered hero pieces first.

**Prompt template:**
> Studio product photograph of a single {{garment}} laid flat on a clean {{neutral backdrop color from brief}} seamless backdrop. {{Fabric weight + technique — 8oz garment-dyed jersey, 14oz brushed-back fleece, paneled supplex nylon, brushed merino-cotton knit, etc.}} in {{specific colorway}}, {{fit notes — cropped boxy, oversized dropped-shoulder, regular fit with horn buttons, etc.}}. Embellishments per brief: {{precise description — placement, technique, color, scale, exact wordmark text matching the brief}}. Soft directional light from upper-left, gentle shadow under the garment, no model, no hands, no other props. Editorial catalog quality, sharp focus on every embellishment loop and seam.

**MCP call shape:**
```
mcp__higgsfield__generate_image(params={
  model: 'nano_banana_pro',
  aspect_ratio: '4:5',
  resolution: '2k',
  prompt: '<built from template>',
  medias: [
    { value: '<Round 2 wordmark mnemonic job_id>', role: 'image' },
    { value: '<Round 2 motif mnemonic job_id>',    role: 'image' }
  ]
})
```

Fire all SKU mockups in parallel. **Poll to completion.** These job_ids become the input library for Rounds 4, 5, and 6.

---

### Round 4 — Line sheet

The gridded composite. One image, all SKUs visible. References all Round 3 mockups via `medias[]` so the line sheet *matches* the individual pieces instead of drifting into a different visual rendering of them.

- **Model:** `nano_banana_pro`
- **Aspect:** `4:3`
- **Cost:** ~2 credits
- **References:** all Round 3 mockup job_ids in `medias[]`
- **Vocabulary sources** ([`glossary.md`](./glossary.md)): §1–§2 (vocabulary for the mono spec callouts under each piece — `fabric · weight` line), §7 (backdrop tone description if the brief calls for a specific wash-coded neutral). The composition itself is described prose-style in the target-structure block below — not pulled from the glossary.

**Prompt template:**
> Tech-pack flat-lay line sheet of the {{brand}} {{occasion}} merch capsule on a {{neutral backdrop color from brief}} seamless backdrop, soft top-down studio light, catalog presentation. Show {{N}} garments gridded in a {{4-across-by-2-down / 3×3 / etc.}} layout: {{list each piece with one-line spec}}. Each garment sits with even spacing, faint mono spec text below it (fabric · colorway · embellishment hint). No models, no hands, subtle drop shadows only. Wholesale line sheet quality.

**Target structure** for the line sheet image — read this carefully and bake every element into the prompt:

- **Grid:** clean and regular. 4-across-by-2-down for 8 SKUs; 3×3 for 9; 3×2 for 6. Even spacing, generous margins around each piece.
- **Backdrop:** a single neutral tone from the brief's palette (cream, bone, paper, off-white, etc.). No textures, no gradients.
- **Light:** even top-down studio light, soft drop shadows only, no harsh raking.
- **Spec callouts:** under each piece, three short lines of mono text — `fabric · weight`, `colorway`, `embellishment hint`. Faint and tonal, never loud.
- **Range across silhouettes:** the cells should cover different garment categories — a knit, a button-up, a tee, an outerwear piece, a footwear piece, an accessory or hat, plus whatever pieces are specific to the brief. Don't put eight tees in the grid.
- **Hierarchy:** all garments at the same scale and centered in their cells. No piece is hero in the line sheet — that's what the product hero shots are for.
- **Restraint:** zero stylization on the image itself. The garments do the talking; the grid is utility infrastructure.

The reference quality bar: a wholesale tech-pack page from a heritage merch agency — clean enough to send to a manufacturer.

Fire as a single call. **Poll to completion.**

---

### Round 5 — Model in environment

Lookbook portraits. Each shot composites three references via `medias[]`:
1. A Round 0 Cast portrait (the *person* — same character across all shots they're in)
2. A Round 3 mockup (the *garment* — same fabric, fit, embellishments as the flat-lay)
3. A Round 1 location plate (the *world* — same physical place as the establishing shot)

This is the round that needed the prior context most — without it, the lookbook drifts into generic AI-fashion territory, the garment drifts off-brief, and the man in shot A is a different man from the man in shot B.

- **Model:** `nano_banana_pro`
- **Aspect:** `4:5`
- **Cost:** ~2 credits each
- **Count:** 1 / 2 / 3 by tier
- **References:** Cast portrait + Round 3 mockup + Round 1 location (all in `medias[]`)
- **Cast assignment:** alternate which character wears which piece. Don't put the menswear hero piece on the female character and vice versa unless the line is genuinely unisex.
- **Vocabulary sources** ([`glossary.md`](./glossary.md)): §10 (Photography & lighting) — the lighting + film stock + focal-length clauses must echo the Round 1 location plate the shot is set in. Everything else (fabric, fit, embellishments) is carried into the composite by the Round 3 mockup reference in `medias[]` and doesn't need to be re-described in prose.

**Prompt template:**
> Editorial lookbook portrait, {{full-body / three-quarter / mid-shot}}. The character from the portrait reference wears the {{specific Round 3 garment}} in {{colorway}}, styled with {{trouser/shoe/accessory}}. Setting: the {{Round 1 location — described again concretely, not just referenced}}. {{Lighting matching the Round 1 plate — golden hour low side-light, hangar fluorescent overhead, etc.}}. Shot on {{35mm film stock / digital with medium-format feel}}, {{focal length}} equivalent compression. Subject {{posture / gaze}}. The {{garment}} is the hero; every embellishment readable. Composite the three references so the person matches the portrait, the garment matches the mockup, and the environment matches the location plate.

**MCP call shape:**
```
mcp__higgsfield__generate_image(params={
  model: 'nano_banana_pro',
  aspect_ratio: '4:5',
  resolution: '2k',
  prompt: '<built from template>',
  medias: [
    { value: '<best Round 0 cast portrait job_id for this character>', role: 'image' },
    { value: '<Round 3 specific mockup job_id>',                       role: 'image' },
    { value: '<Round 1 location job_id>',                              role: 'image' }
  ]
})
```

Fire all lookbook portraits in parallel. **Poll to completion.**

---

### Round 6 — Hero image

The cinematic 16:9 wide that anchors the website. Composites the same three reference types as Round 5 — but selects the strongest of each: the best Round 1 location plate, the hero-piece Round 3 mockup, and the Round 0 portrait of the character who wears the hero piece in the lookbook. The website then reads as "one consistent person, multiple shots, one consistent world."

- **Model:** `nano_banana_pro`
- **Aspect:** `16:9`
- **Cost:** ~2 credits
- **References:** Cast portrait (of the hero-piece wearer) + Round 1 best location + Round 3 hero-piece mockup (all in `medias[]`)
- **Vocabulary sources** ([`glossary.md`](./glossary.md)): §10 (Photography & lighting) — lighting + film stock + focal-length clauses must echo the chosen Round 1 location plate. The hero garment language is carried by the Round 3 mockup reference and doesn't need re-describing.

**Hero composition rule (unchanged from prior version of this skill):**

The hero tells the brand-world story in one frame. **Derive every element from `BRIEF.md`** — palette, setting, character archetype, embellishment, and a single brand-world cue. The recipe:

1. **Character** — one stand-in (never a named real person) fitting the brand's audience, in the hero piece + hero colorway. Pose relaxed, in motion or about-to-move — never posed-static or aspirational-staring-into-distance.
2. **Setting** — the single Round 1 location that anchors the brand world best. One place, not a mash-up.
3. **One atmospheric brand cue** — a single environmental detail that reads as "this is *that* brand's world" without being the subject. Treat it small, distant, in-shadow, or peripheral. Whatever the brief established as the brand-world anchor lands here, atmospheric not literal.
4. **Light + film stock** — golden hour or first light by default unless the brief says otherwise. Specify film stock or "medium-format feel" to push away from AI gloss.
5. **No literal collisions.** If the brief intersects two worlds (e.g. aviation × surf), the hero never composites them — pick the stronger one for the location and let the other live only in the merch on the character.

**Worked examples are illustrative of the RECIPE only — the cue type varies entirely with the brand.** Look at the *shape* of each example, not the vocabulary:

- Aviation/sport brand: character walks toward camera in hero piece; *small aircraft high overhead*. Cue = peripheral, aspirational, distant.
- Heritage country brand: character on a dirt road at sunset in hero piece; *taillights of a vehicle far behind them*. Cue = distant, atmospheric, narrative.
- Sponsorship/match brand: character near a venue entrance in hero piece; *rolled banners or signage propped against a wall behind them*. Cue = peripheral, ambient, contextual.
- Touring/music brand: character in a loading-dock alley at first light in hero piece; *road cases deep in shadow*. Cue = in-shadow, suggestive, behind-the-scenes.

Note what's consistent: character + setting from the brief's world + a single cue treated atmospheric (small / distant / shadowed / peripheral). The cue is **never** the subject. The merch is. The specific cue type is whatever the brief's brand-world dictates — vehicle, building element, equipment, signage, landscape detail — never imposed by the skill.

**Prompt template:**
> Cinematic wide editorial photograph, {{time of day}} at {{location — matching Round 1 plate}}. A {{age, vibe}} stand-in model {{action — walking, leaning, standing}} {{specific staging}}. They wear the {{brand}} {{hero garment from Round 3}} in {{colorway}}, {{embellishments described concretely}}. Styled with {{trouser/shoe/accessory specifics}}. The setting includes: {{1–3 environmental elements matching the Round 1 plate}}. {{ONE atmospheric brand cue — small, distant, peripheral, never centered. Phrase as "in the distance / high above / deep in shadow / far behind, a single ___"}}. {{Light direction matching Round 1}}. Shot on {{film stock}}, {{grain notes}}, {{focal length}}. Subject {{posture}}, looking {{direction}}. Editorial lookbook quality. Wide cinematic framing. The merch is the hero; the cue is atmospheric.

**MCP call shape:**
```
mcp__higgsfield__generate_image(params={
  model: 'nano_banana_pro',
  aspect_ratio: '16:9',
  resolution: '4k',
  prompt: '<built from template>',
  medias: [
    { value: '<Cast portrait job_id of hero-piece wearer>', role: 'image' },
    { value: '<best Round 1 location job_id>',              role: 'image' },
    { value: '<Round 3 hero-piece mockup job_id>',          role: 'image' }
  ]
})
```

Fire. Poll to completion.

---

### Polling pattern (every round)

After issuing the round's parallel calls, poll each `job_id` with:
```
mcp__higgsfield__job_status(jobId='<id>', sync=true)
```
in parallel. `sync: true` blocks up to ~25s server-side and returns on terminal state. For image jobs (10–20s typical) this usually completes in a single poll round. If any return non-terminal, wait the `poll_after_seconds` value and try again.

**Save every `results.rawUrl` and `job_id` as you go** — write them into a working state structure (in your head or a scratch file). You'll need:
- `job_id`s for `medias[]` references in later rounds
- `rawUrl`s for `<img src>` values in the final `index.html`

---

## Phase 4 — Real brand logo

For the site nav and any "real-brand" lockups, use the **actual** logo file, not the AI-rendered approximations.

1. **First try the Higgsfield brand kit** (queued in Phase 1, almost certainly done by now after Phase 3 finishes):
   ```
   mcp__higgsfield__show_marketing_studio(
     action='get', type='brand_kit', brand_kit_id='<from phase 1>'
   )
   ```
   Check `data.logo` — but **inspect it visually before using**. The scraped logo from a brand's homepage is often a *campaign lockup* (e.g. "Dance Your Style Qualifier Northeast USA"), not the primary mark. If it's a campaign asset, skip to step 2.

2. **Fallback: Wikimedia Commons.** For major brands, the primary SVG mark almost always lives on Wikipedia. Find it by:
   ```bash
   curl -sL -A "Mozilla/5.0" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<Brand>" | \
     grep -oE 'upload\.wikimedia\.org/[^"]+\.svg' | head -10
   ```
   Then download the SVG. SVGs scale crisply at any size — preferred over PNGs.

3. **Last resort:** search via `/browse` or WebSearch for "<brand> logo SVG site:wikimedia.org" or "<brand> brand assets press".

4. Save as `logo-<brand-slug>.svg` (or `.png`) in the working folder.

---

## Phase 5 — Compose the deliverable

In the working folder, write four files plus the logo and fonts:

```
~/Documents/merch-briefs/<brand-slug>-<YYYY-MM-DD>/
├── BRIEF.md           ← from Phase 2
├── INDEX.md           ← gallery of all job IDs + prompts
├── index.html         ← branded single-page site (this phase)
├── og.png             ← 1200×630 social share card (this phase)
├── build_og.py        ← script that builds og.png
├── logo-<brand>.svg   ← from Phase 5
└── fonts/             ← brand-chosen display + label TTFs (see 5b for selection)
    ├── <DisplayFamily-Style>.ttf
    └── <MonoFamily>.ttf
```

### 5a — `INDEX.md`

Gallery linking the brief sections to each generated artifact, with the prompt and Higgsfield job ID for each. Format:

```markdown
# {{Brand}} — Visual Tech Pack

[Read the brief →](./BRIEF.md)

*Generated YYYY-MM-DD · {{tier}} tier · {{N}} images · {{credits}} credits*

To re-display any artifact: `mcp__higgsfield__job_display` with the job ID.

## 1 · Range Grid (Hero)
- **Job:** `<id>`
- **Model:** `nano_banana_pro` · **Aspect:** 4:3 · **Resolution:** 1k
- **Prompt:** > {{full prompt}}

... etc. for each artifact ...
```

### 5b — Download fonts

Pick a **display family** and a **label/mono family** based on the brief's `## Typography` section. The choice is brand-driven — examples of valid pairings, not a prescription:

| Brand type | Display family (example) | Label/mono (example) |
|---|---|---|
| Sport / paddock / aviation | A condensed italic grotesque (e.g. Barlow Condensed Black Italic) | A clean technical mono (e.g. JetBrains Mono) |
| Heritage / country / archive | A wide serif or slab (e.g. Recoleta, Domaine Display) | A typewriter mono (e.g. IBM Plex Mono) |
| Luxury / restraint | A high-contrast serif (e.g. Editorial New, Canela) | A geometric sans (e.g. Söhne) |
| Streetwear / festival | A heavy display sans (e.g. Druk Wide, ABC Diatype) | A condensed mono (e.g. Berkeley Mono) |

Use **only Google Fonts or other OFL-licensed families** so the TTFs can be downloaded for the OG builder and the site can load them via Google Fonts CDN.

Download the two chosen TTFs into `fonts/` once (paths vary by family — search `https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/ofl/<family-slug>`):

```bash
mkdir -p fonts
curl -sL -o fonts/<DisplayFamily-Style>.ttf \
  "https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/ofl/<family-slug>/<DisplayFamily-Style>.ttf"
curl -sL -o fonts/<MonoFamily>.ttf \
  "https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/ofl/<mono-slug>/<MonoFamily>.ttf"
```

The HTML loads them via Google Fonts CDN; the `fonts/` directory is only required by `build_og.py` (which reads TTFs directly via PIL).

### 5c — `index.html` (branded single-page site)

**Structural sections (top to bottom). Each section has a *role*; the brand picks the noun-phrase title to put on it.**

1. **Optional top ornament** — a thin marquee strip / sponsor band / news-ticker / data-band, only if it fits the brand vibe. Skip for restrained / luxury brands; include for sport / festival / streetwear.
2. **Sticky nav** — `[real brand logo SVG] | [property name set in the brief's display family]` on the left; small mono stamp on the right (coordinates, date, edition number — whatever the brief established).
3. **Full-bleed hero** — Round 6 image at native aspect (typically 16:9), with:
   - Small mono kicker (top-left or top-center)
   - Title in the brief's display family (bottom-left over a gentle gradient overlay)
   - Up to 3 short mono meta chips beneath the title
4. **§01 Range** — the line sheet (Round 4 image), full-width inside a tonal frame, single-line mono caption below.
5. **§02 Featured pieces** — 2- or 3-column grid of product hero cards. Each card = a Round 3 mockup + a spec sheet (mono key/value pairs).
6. **§03 Lookbook** — Round 5 portraits in a 1- or 2-column grid. Often a darker / inverted-palette section so the figures pop.
7. **§04 Detail** — Round 2 mnemonics in a 2-column macro grid (the embellishment / motif / palette-tile close-ups).
8. **§05 Context** — wide contextual placement, often a 5:3 image+copy split. One image, one short caption.
9. **§06 Brief** — palette swatches + range table side-by-side. No prose.
10. **Footer** — 3–4 short mono columns (brief metadata, coordinates, render stack, note), small colophon line.

**Section titles are noun-phrases derived from the brief.** Defaults are *Range / Featured / Lookbook / Detail / Context / Brief* — but a brand might call its Context section "On the road" or "Off-season" depending on its world. Never use the example titles literally if the brand wants different ones.

**Copy discipline (this is non-negotiable):**
- Section heads are nouns or short noun-phrases derived from the brand's world. One or two words preferred.
- No "ledes" or "subtitles" under section heads. The image and the spec card do the talking.
- No agency-speak: never use "fluid medium", "smart-not-literal", "the proof the line is real", "two X one Y", "elevated international register", "the day after the night before", "carries the line / throws it back / softens it", or any other tortured "X meets Y" / "where A meets B" formulation.
- Caption format: `<noun-phrase>` · `<technical detail>`. Plain factual phrases, not literary.
- Spec cards: 4 fields max (Fabric / Fit / Color / Detail). Each field is a noun phrase, not a sentence.
- Hero meta: max 3 chips. Avoid "pillar / audience / drop window" pseudo-fields — use concrete chips like piece count, season, location.

**CSS design tokens — role-based, populated from the brief's palette.** Use these *role names* in the stylesheet, not stylized palette names. The hex values come from the brief; the roles stay constant across brands.

```css
:root {
  --bg:           #__;  /* primary neutral / page background */
  --bg-card:      #__;  /* tonal depth for cards (slightly darker/warmer than --bg) */
  --bg-shadow:   #__;   /* hairline border tone */
  --depth:        #__;  /* depth color used for dark sections (often a navy/ink) */
  --hero:         #__;  /* the brand's hero color — most prominent garment color */
  --secondary:    #__;  /* secondary brand color */
  --accent:       #__;  /* single bright accent, used sparingly */
  --sigil:        #__;  /* brand red / signature color, sigil-only (never a field) */
  --hardware:     #__;  /* neutral grey for labels / hardware tone */
  --ink:          #__;  /* body text / deepest neutral */
}
```

Populate from the brief's `## Palette` section. The number of fields can shrink (a 4-color brief uses fewer role tokens) but the names stay the same so the rest of the CSS is portable.

**Typography stack — two families chosen per Section 5b:**

- **Display family**: drives titles, section heads, the hero word, big numeric callouts. Reach for the weight/style the brief calls for (italic black, condensed bold, high-contrast serif, etc.).
- **Label/mono family**: drives kickers, captions, spec-sheet key/value pairs, footer columns, the marquee strip if present.

Generic CSS pattern:
```css
.display-title  { font-family: var(--display); font-weight: 900; }
.display-sub    { font-family: var(--display); font-weight: 700; }
.label, .mono   { font-family: var(--mono); letter-spacing: 0.18em; text-transform: uppercase; }
.spec-key       { font-family: var(--mono); font-size: 9.5px; letter-spacing: 0.18em; }
.spec-val       { font-family: var(--mono); font-size: 11px; }
```

Letter-spacing for tracked all-caps mono labels: `0.18em–0.28em` (tighter for body mono, looser for tracked all-caps).

**Open Graph + Twitter meta** in `<head>`:
```html
<meta property="og:type" content="website">
<meta property="og:title" content="{{Brand}} · {{Occasion}}">
<meta property="og:description" content="{{1 short sentence}}">
<meta property="og:image" content="og.png">
<meta property="og:image:width" content="1200">
<meta property="og:image:height" content="630">
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="og.png">
<meta name="theme-color" content="{{forest or hero color}}">
```

### 5d — `build_og.py` (OG card builder)

A self-contained Python script that composites the OG card from one of the generated assets. Drop this file in the working folder, then run:

```bash
uv run --with Pillow build_og.py
```

Template (the structure stays constant across brands; the palette RGB tuples, font filenames, title strings, and bottom-strip content all come from the brief):

```python
"""Build og.png (1200×630) from a generated range-grid asset.

Layout is constant across brands:
  - Right column (~64% width):  range-grid asset, cover-cropped
  - Left column (~36% width):   solid hero-color band, stacked display title
  - Top edge:                   thin accent stripe
  - Bottom-right strip:         optional mono ornament strip
The palette RGB tuples and font paths below are populated from the brief.

After writing the file, run `uv run --with Pillow build_og.py` and confirm `og.png` is generated.

### 5e — Important: don't download generated images

Higgsfield's CDN serves the 9 + 1 generated images directly. **Embed them in the HTML by CDN URL** — don't `curl` them into the repo. The site references `https://d8j0ntlcm91z4.cloudfront.net/...` URLs and stays small. The only image committed to the repo is `og.png` (which is built from one CDN asset by `build_og.py`).

### 5f — `README.md` and `.gitignore`

Always add a brief `README.md` explaining the deliverable and a `.gitignore` (default: `.DS_Store .vercel/ __pycache__/ *.pyc .venv/ venv/ node_modules/`).

The `Launch preview` hook will surface `index.html` to the user as soon as it's written. No need to `open` it manually.

---

## Phase 6 — Ship *(optional, gated)*

Only execute Phase 6 if the user explicitly says "ship", "deploy", "publish", "push it live", or sets `ship=true`. **Always gate before pushing or deploying** — these are externally-visible actions.

### 6a — GitHub: private repo + push

```bash
cd ~/Documents/merch-briefs/<brand-slug>-<YYYY-MM-DD>
git init -q -b main
git add -A
git commit -q -m "Initial concept deck — <Brand> · <Occasion>"
gh repo create <repo-name> \
  --private \
  --source=. \
  --remote=origin \
  --description "Concept merch tech-pack deck — <Brand> × <Occasion>" \
  --push
```

Pick a short, distinctive `<repo-name>` (e.g. `rbar-venice-beach`, not the long dated folder name).

### 6b — Vercel: deploy under the right team

1. Confirm the user's Vercel team slug: `vercel teams list`
2. Deploy to production:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod --scope <team-slug> --yes --name <repo-name>
   ```
3. Connect the deployment to the GitHub repo for auto-deploy on push:
   ```bash
   vercel git connect --scope <team-slug> --yes
   ```

Surface the production URL (e.g. `https://<repo-name>.vercel.app`) and the inspector URL to the user.

### 6c — Future iteration

Any subsequent change (new image, copy tweak, new section) becomes:
```bash
git add . && git commit -m "..." && git push
```
Vercel auto-deploys on push to `main`. Preview URLs come from PR branches.

---

## Iteration loop

After delivery, common iteration asks:

| Ask | Move |
|---|---|
| "Show more variants of piece X" | Reuse the prompt from `INDEX.md`, tweak the colorway/material/embellishment, regenerate via `generate_image` |
| "Different model in the lookbook" | Re-run Round 0 with the new character description, then re-run the affected Round 5 shots passing the new Cast `job_id` |
| "Add a new piece (e.g. boardshort)" | Add a row to the range plan in `BRIEF.md` + the table in `index.html`, generate one new product hero |
| "Different content in the top ornament strip" | Adjust the `.strip-inner` text in the HTML; also adjust the OG card's bottom-right ornament strip if used |
| "Change palette" | Edit the CSS custom properties in `index.html` + the RGB tuples in `build_og.py`, re-run the OG script |
| "Different hero image" | Re-issue the Phase 4 prompt with adjustments, swap the `<img src>` in the hero section |
| "Add the real logo" | Phase 5 — Wikimedia → `logo-<brand>.svg` → add to nav, replacing any homemade glyph |
| "Ship it" | Phase 6 |

If the user wants a re-rendered OG card after a brand change, **regenerate** by re-running `build_og.py` — don't try to edit the existing PNG.

---

## Guardrails

- **Real-person likeness:** never name a real public figure as the model in any prompt. If the brand is associated with an artist/athlete, describe a stylistic stand-in ("a young athlete with comparable energy"), not the person.
- **Trademark fidelity:** wordmarks in generated images are approximate. **The real logo only lives in `logo-<brand>.svg` in the nav** — never composite the real logo onto a generated image. Always note in the brief and footer that this is a concept deck, not production artwork.
- **Credit spend:** standard tier = 9 + 1 = ~17 credits. Deluxe = ~23 credits. Always preflight cost and confirm before bulk generation.
- **Don't edit images.** When the user asks to "use the real logo on the site" or similar, that means **the HTML**, not the AI-generated images. The 9 tech-pack images and the hero stay as Higgsfield generated them. Compose around them, never on top of them.
- **Originality:** when researching a brand's past merch, treat it as reference, not template — the deliverable should feel like the *next* drop, not a copy of last year's.
- **Ship gating:** Phase 6 publishes externally visible artifacts (GitHub repo, Vercel URL). Always confirm before running. A `--private` repo is the default for personal accounts.
- **Brand-kit logo scrutiny:** Higgsfield's brand-kit fetch often returns a *campaign lockup* rather than the primary mark. Always inspect visually before using. Wikimedia Commons is the canonical source for primary brand marks.
